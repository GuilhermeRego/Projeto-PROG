# Image Processing Script
A project for the Programação (Programming) 2022-2023 course at FEUP, implementing various image processing operations through a script-based interface. This README provides a summary of the project.

## Overview
### Features

- Image manipulation including inversion, grayscale conversion, and mirroring.
- Image cropping, rotation, and median filtering.
- Script-based command execution for batch processing.

### Architecture
- Color Class: Stores RGB information for each pixel of an image.
- Image Class: Manages image data and provides pixel manipulation methods.
- Script Class: Parses and executes commands from a script file.

### Conclusions
It was a good project to learn the basics about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
